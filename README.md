[![custom-sericea](https://github.com/mitchejj/u-sway/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mitchejj/u-sway/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A base image with a (mostly) stock Fedora Sericea. This build is using
pre-released builds. This is **NOT** a Fedora build. This is **NOT** a ublue-os build. 

## What is this?

This is a base Fedora Sericea (still in development & pre-beta) image derived from [ublue-os](http://ublue.it) base image/build system.

## Usage

Warning: This is an experimental feature and should not be used in production (yet), however it's pretty close) Depending on the version of rpm-ostree on your system you might need to pass an additional `--experimental` flag

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite machine to the latest build (38): 

    sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/mitchejj/custom-sericea:38
    

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. Note that when a new version of Fedora is released that the `latest` tag will get updated to that latest release automatically. 

## Features

- Start with a base Fedora Silverblue 37 image
- Removes Firefox from the base image
- Adds the following packages to the base image:
  - distrobox 
- Sets automatic staging of updates for the system
- Sets flatpaks to update twice a day
- Everything else (desktop, artwork, etc) remains stock so you can use this as a good starting image

## Applications

### TO-DO
- Core GNOME Applications installed from Flathub
  - GNOME Calculator, Calendar, Characters, Connections, Contacts, Evince, Firmware, Logs, Maps, NautilusPreviewer, TextEditor, Weather, baobab, clocks, eog, and font-viewer

## Further Customization

The `just` task runner is included for further customization after first boot.
TODO: It will copy the template from `/etc/justfile` to your home directory.
After that run the following commands:

- `just` - Show all tasks, more will be added in the future
- `just bios` - Reboot into the system bios (Useful for dualbooting)
- `just changelogs` - Show the changelogs of the pending update
- Set up distroboxes for the following images:
  - `just distrobox-boxkit`
  - `just distrobox-debian`
  - `just distrobox-opensuse`
  - `just distrobox-ubuntu`
- `just setup-flatpaks` - Install a selection of flatpaks, use this section to add your own apps
- `just setup-gaming` - Install Steam, Heroic Game Launcher, OBS Studio, Discord, Boatswain, Bottles, and ProtonUp-Qt. MangoHud is installed and enabled by default, hit right Shift-F12 to toggle
- `just update` - Update rpm-ostree, flatpaks, and distroboxes in one command
